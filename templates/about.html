                <p>
                    Music Score Cropper is a web application designed to help musicians optimize their PDF music scores 
                    for viewing on tablets, especially iPads. By automatically cropping unnecessary margins from your 
                    sheet music, you can enjoy larger, more readable notes and annotations.

                <h3>Why Crop PDF Scores?</h3>
                <p>
                    Many PDF music scores contain large margins that waste valuable screen space. When viewing these 
                    scores on tablets or e-readers, the actual music notation becomes smaller than it needs to be. 
                    By cropping these margins, you can:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>See larger musical notation</li>
                    <li>Reduce eye strain during practice</li>
                    <li>Make better use of your tablet's screen</li>
                    <li>Improve readability, especially for complex scores</li>
                </ul>
